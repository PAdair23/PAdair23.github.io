		<h2>What is a mechanical keyboard</h2>
		<img class="float" src="pictures/diagram.gif" alt="mechanical keyswitch diagram">
		<p>
		Non mechanical keyboards have rubber domes underneath with small conductive layers attached on either side of it, when you 
		press down on the key, it forces the 2 conductive layers together to signal your computer that the key is being pressed.
		This requires the key to be pressed all the way down and leads to a mushy feeling keyboard. 
		Mechanical keyboards use a physical switch with multiple parts underneath the cap. When pressing down the keys, you eventually hit
		the actuation point (typically around 2mm) that sends the signal to your computer that the key has been pressed. These switches are faster,
		more tactile, and last longer than membrane keyboards.

		There are also many types of shapes and sizes that mechanical keyboards come in. Some of the most common are full standard layout,
		60%, and split. you can learn more about each layout and see pictures <a href="https://blog.wooting.nl/the-ultimate-guide-to-keyboard-layouts-and-form-factors/">Here</a>
